## Degree Hunt- A Game in Python

- About: The map of the game is designed on the structure of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). The game assumes that on the day of convocation, the player got extraordinarily excited after receiving the degree that he lost it somewhere in the university premises. Now, the player is given an opportunity to find his degree by answering some knowledgeable and sensible questions. Thus, the game is puzzling and adventurous and is basically like a ‘2D Treasure Hunt’ game.
- Hardware Required: Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse
- Software Required: Windows 8 or 10, Python (2.7.12), Pygame (1.9.2), Tkinter (8.5), Easygui (0.96) 
- This project is an outcome of the course ‘CO395 Minor Project’ instructed by Prof. Mohammad Sarosh Umar and Ms. Syeda Shira Moin.
